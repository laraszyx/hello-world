Hi, there! My name is Cat and I have only know the very basics of coding (maybe even less!) What is it that I'm doing here? Well, I am interested in learning to code, more specifically, how to design and build websites, learn coding languages like Python, C++, and Mathlab for data science. I am a Biology master student and coding would be really helpful in my line of work. 
That is all and congrats for reading this far!
